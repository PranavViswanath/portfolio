        <h1>fundamental beliefs</h1>

        <p class="lede">
            here are the principles that guide my thinking and work.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>curiosity is the foundation.</strong> the best work comes from genuine interest 
            in understanding how things work and why they work that way.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>complexity should be hidden, not eliminated.</strong> good systems make complex 
            operations simple for users while preserving the power underneath.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>learning is iterative.</strong> the fastest way to learn is to build, test, 
            and iterate quickly rather than planning everything upfront.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>technology should serve humans.</strong> the goal isn't to build impressive 
            systems, but to solve real problems that make people's lives better.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>collaboration amplifies impact.</strong> the best solutions come from diverse 
            perspectives working together toward shared goals.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>ethics can't be an afterthought.</strong> considering the broader implications 
            of technology should be built into the development process from day one.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>simplicity is a feature.</strong> the most elegant solutions are often the 
            simplest ones that solve the core problem without unnecessary complexity.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>failure is data.</strong> mistakes and setbacks are opportunities to learn 
            and improve, not reasons to give up.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>impact over recognition.</strong> the goal is to create value and solve problems, 
            not to build a personal brand or accumulate accolades.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>continuous improvement.</strong> there's always room to get better, learn more, 
            and refine both skills and understanding.
        </p>
